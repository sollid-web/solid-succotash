            </p>

            <h2>No Guarantee of Returns</h2>
            <p>
                Investment returns are subject to market conditions and platform performance. Past performance
                does not guarantee future results. All investments carry inherent risk, and you may receive
                back less than your original investment amount.
            </p>

            <h2>Regulatory Status</h2>

            <p>
                Platform features, including virtual cards and investment plans, are subject to availability
                and approval. WolvCapital reserves the right to modify or discontinue services at any time

                All transactions undergo manual off-chain review for security purposes. This process may result
                in processing delays but ensures maximum protection against fraud and unauthorized activity.
