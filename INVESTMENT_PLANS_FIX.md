# Investment Plans Visibility Fix

## Problem
Investment plans were not visible on the home page and dashboard.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Views (`core/views.py`)

#### HomeView
Added `get_context_data` method to include investment plans:
```python
class HomeView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'core/home.html'

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        try:
            context['plans'] = InvestmentPlan.objects.all().order_by('min_amount')
        except Exception as e:
            context['plans'] = []
        return context
```

#### DashboardView
Added investment plans to context data:
```python
# Get all investment plans
all_plans = InvestmentPlan.objects.all().order_by('min_amount')

context.update({
    # ... existing context ...
    'all_plans': all_plans,
})
```

### 2. Updated Templates

#### Home Page (`templates/core/home.html`)
Added a new "Investment Plans Section" between the Cryptocurrency Support section and Features section:

**Features:**
- 4-column grid layout (responsive: 1 col on mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop)
- Each plan displayed as a card with:
  - Gradient header showing plan name and daily ROI
  - Duration, min/max amounts
  - Total return percentage highlighted in green
  - "Start Investing" CTA button
- "View All Details" button at the bottom linking to `/plans/`

#### Dashboard (`templates/core/dashboard.html`)
Added "Available Investment Plans" section above "Active Investments":

**Features:**
- Compact 4-column grid layout
- Shows all available plans with key details
- Quick reference for users before investing
- Link to detailed plans page in section header

### 3. Seeding Investment Plans

The platform includes 4 default investment plans:

| Plan | Daily ROI | Duration | Min Amount | Max Amount | Total ROI |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Pioneer | 1.00% | 14 days | $100 | $999 | 14% |
| Vanguard | 1.25% | 21 days | $1,000 | $4,999 | 26.25% |
| Horizon | 1.50% | 30 days | $5,000 | $14,999 | 45% |
| Summit | 2.00% | 45 days | $15,000 | $100,000 | 90% |

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows (CMD)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 4: Seed Investment Plans
```bash
python manage.py seed_plans
```

Expected output:
```
Created plan: Pioneer
Created plan: Vanguard
Created plan: Horizon
Created plan: Summit
Successfully created 4 new plan(s)
```

Or if plans already exist:
```
Plan already exists: Pioneer
Plan already exists: Vanguard
Plan already exists: Horizon
Plan already exists: Summit
Successfully created 0 new plan(s)
```

### Step 5: Restart Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 6: Verify Changes

1. **Home Page** (`http://localhost:8000/`)
   - Scroll down to see "Our Investment Plans" section
   - Should show 4 plan cards with all details
   - Click "View All Details" to go to plans page

2. **Dashboard** (`http://localhost:8000/dashboard/`)
   - Log in if not authenticated
   - See "Available Investment Plans" section near the top
   - Shows compact view of all 4 plans
   - Use for quick reference before investing

3. **Plans Page** (`http://localhost:8000/plans/`)
   - Detailed view of all investment plans
   - Should already be working

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Plans Don't Show Up

**Solution 1: Check if plans are seeded**
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
```python
from investments.models import InvestmentPlan
print(InvestmentPlan.objects.count())  # Should return 4
print(InvestmentPlan.objects.all())
```

**Solution 2: Manually seed plans**
```bash
python manage.py seed_plans
```

**Solution 3: Check database**
```bash
python manage.py dbshell
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM investments_investmentplan;
```

### Issue: Template Errors

**Check for:**
1. Correct template syntax ({% %} and {{ }})
2. Missing context variables
3. Template inheritance issues
4. Static files loading

**Debug:**
```python
# In views.py, add print statement
def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
    context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
    plans = InvestmentPlan.objects.all()
    print(f"Plans count: {plans.count()}")  # Debug
    context['plans'] = plans
    return context
```

### Issue: Database Not Updated

**Reset migrations (development only):**
```bash
# Delete database (SQLite)
rm db.sqlite3

# Or PostgreSQL
python manage.py dbshell
DROP DATABASE wolvcapital;
CREATE DATABASE wolvcapital;

# Recreate everything
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py seed_plans
```

## Production Deployment

### For Render.com or similar platforms:

1. **Ensure seed command runs on deployment**

   Add to `render.yaml` or build script:
   ```yaml
   buildCommand: |
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python manage.py migrate
     python manage.py seed_plans
     python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
   ```

2. **Or use release command**

   In `Procfile`:
   ```
   release: python manage.py migrate && python manage.py seed_plans
   web: gunicorn wolvcapital.wsgi
   ```

3. **Manual deployment check**
   ```bash
   # SSH into production or use admin panel
   python manage.py seed_plans
   ```

## Files Modified
