Greed is subtle. It often appears as confidence.

In crypto markets, unchecked greed leads to unnecessary risk.

## How greed shows up

- increasing exposure too quickly
- ignoring risk management
- chasing unrealistic returns

## How to stay grounded

- stick to plans
- reassess goals
- prioritize sustainability
