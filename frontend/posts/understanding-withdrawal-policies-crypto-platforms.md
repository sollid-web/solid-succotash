Withdrawal policies are one of the most important — and often overlooked — aspects of crypto investment platforms.

Understanding how withdrawals work helps investors set realistic expectations and avoid misunderstandings.

## Why Withdrawal Policies Matter
Withdrawal terms define:
- When funds can be accessed
- What conditions apply
- How requests are processed

Clear policies reduce uncertainty.

## Common Withdrawal Structures
Platforms may implement:
- Fixed investment durations
- Scheduled withdrawal windows
- Manual approval processes

Each structure has implications for liquidity and planning.

## Questions Investors Should Ask
Before investing, consider:
- Are timelines clearly stated?
- Are conditions explained upfront?
- Is communication consistent?
