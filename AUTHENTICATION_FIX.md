# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
Users could sign up successfully and be redirected to dashboard, but when trying to log in, they would be returned to the login page instead of being authenticated.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Wrong User Model Import in Signals** ❌
**File**: `users/signals.py`

**Problem**:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User  # Wrong!
```

The code was importing Django's default User model instead of the custom User model defined in `users.models.User`.

**Fix**:
```python
from django.conf import settings
# Use settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL instead
@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
```

This caused the signals (profile and wallet creation) to not fire properly for the custom User model, leading to authentication issues.

### 2. **Missing Authentication Backends** ❌
**File**: `wolvcapital/settings.py`

**Problem**: No explicit `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting defined.

**Fix**: Added:
```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
]
```

### 3. **Session Configuration Issues** ❌
**File**: `wolvcapital/settings.py`

**Problems**:
- `SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = False` - sessions weren't being saved properly
- No explicit session engine specified
- Session cookie settings could cause issues

**Fixes**:
```python
SESSION_ENGINE = "django.contrib.sessions.backends.db"
SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST = True  # Save session on every request
SESSION_COOKIE_NAME = "wolvcapital_sessionid"
SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN = None
```

### 4. **Missing Users' Profiles and Wallets** ❌
Some existing users didn't have profiles or wallets created, causing authentication to fail.

**Fix**: Created management command `fix_admin_login` to:
- Ensure all users have profiles
- Ensure all users have wallets
- Sync admin roles properly

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `users/signals.py` - Fixed User model imports
2. ✅ `wolvcapital/settings.py` - Added auth backends and fixed session config
3. ✅ `core/management/commands/fix_admin_login.py` - Created (new)
4. ✅ `core/management/commands/test_login.py` - Created (new)

### New Management Commands:

#### 1. Fix Admin Login
```bash
python manage.py fix_admin_login
```
Ensures all users have proper profiles and wallets.

#### 2. Test Login
```bash
python manage.py test_login user@example.com password123
```
Tests if authentication works for a specific user.

## How to Apply These Fixes

### On Render.com (Production):

1. **Automatic** - The fixes are already pushed to GitHub, Render will auto-deploy

2. **After deployment, run in Render Shell**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py fix_admin_login
   ```

3. **Test login** - Try logging in with your credentials

### Locally (Development):

1. **Pull the changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Run migrations** (if any):
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Fix existing users**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py fix_admin_login
   ```

4. **Test the application**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Verification

### Test Checklist:
- [ ] User can sign up successfully
- [ ] User can log in successfully
- [ ] User is redirected to dashboard after login
- [ ] Session persists (user stays logged in)
- [ ] User can access protected pages
- [ ] User can log out successfully

### How to Test:

1. **Sign up a new user**:
   - Go to `/signup/`
   - Enter email and password
   - Should redirect to `/dashboard/`

2. **Log out**:
   - Click logout
   - Should redirect to `/`

3. **Log in again**:
   - Go to `/login/`
   - Enter same email and password
   - Should successfully redirect to `/dashboard/` (NOT back to login!)

4. **Check session persistence**:
   - Navigate to different pages
   - Refresh the page
   - Should remain logged in

## Technical Details

### Why Signup Worked But Login Didn't:

**During Signup**:
- Django allauth creates the user
- Signals fire and create profile/wallet
- User is auto-authenticated (no password check needed)
- Redirected to dashboard ✓

**During Login**:
- Django tries to authenticate with password
- Wrong User model in signals caused profile/wallet issues
- Missing authentication backends
- Session not saving properly
- Authentication fails, redirects back to login ✗

### The Fix Flow:

1. ✅ Correct User model in signals → profiles/wallets created properly
2. ✅ Authentication backends → Django can authenticate users
3. ✅ Session configuration → sessions persist across requests
4. ✅ Fix existing users → backfill missing profiles/wallets

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still can't log in after fix
**Solution**:
```bash
python manage.py fix_admin_login
python manage.py test_login your@email.com your_password
```

### Issue: "User matching query does not exist"
**Solution**: User doesn't have a profile. Run:
```bash
python manage.py fix_admin_login
```

### Issue: Session expires immediately
**Solution**: Check cookie settings in settings.py. In production, ensure:
```python
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True  # Only on HTTPS
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

In development/Codespaces:
```python
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False
```

## Deployment Status

✅ **Committed**: All fixes committed to Git
✅ **Pushed**: Changes pushed to GitHub (main branch)
✅ **Latest Commit**: `26276b2` - "Fix authentication issues - correct User model imports and session handling"

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Render auto-deploy** (5-10 minutes)
2. **Run in Render Shell**: `python manage.py fix_admin_login`
3. **Test login** on your live site
4. **Verify** using the test checklist above

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Run `python manage.py healthcheck` in Shell
3. Run `python manage.py test_login email@example.com password` to diagnose
