            </p>

            <h2>No Guarantee of Returns</h2>
            <p>
                Investment returns are subject to market conditions and platform performance. Past performance 
                does not guarantee future results. All investments carry inherent risk, and you may receive 
                back less than your original investment amount.
            </p>

            <h2>Regulatory Status</h2>

                WolvCapital operates in accordance with applicable laws and strives to maintain compliance with

            <p>
                Platform features, including virtual cards and investment plans, are subject to availability 
                and approval. WolvCapital reserves the right to modify or discontinue services at any time

            <p>
                All transactions undergo manual off-chain review for security purposes. This process may result 
                in processing delays but ensures maximum protection against fraud and unauthorized activity.
