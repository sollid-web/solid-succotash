A good strategy is not rigid. It is adaptable.

Knowing when to adjust prevents emotional overreaction.

## Valid reasons to adjust

- major life changes
- long-term market shifts
- changes in risk tolerance

## What not to adjust
Avoid reacting to daily price movement.

If you want the goal-setting baseline first, read [How to Set Realistic Crypto Investment Goals](/blog/how-to-set-realistic-crypto-investment-goals).

## Final thoughts
