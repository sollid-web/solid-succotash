                Investing in cryptocurrencies and digital assets involves significant risk. By using WolvCapital,
                you acknowledge and accept the following risks:
            </p>

            <h2>Market Volatility</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Prices may fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably,
                resulting in potential substantial gains or losses. Market movements can be influenced by
                regulatory announcements, technological developments, market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors.
            </p>

            <h2>Regulatory Uncertainty</h2>
            <p>
                The legal and regulatory framework for digital assets is evolving and varies by jurisdiction.
                Changes in laws, regulations, or enforcement actions may impact platform operations, user access,
                or the value of digital assets. Future regulatory developments could restrict or prohibit
                cryptocurrency activities in certain regions.
            </p>

            <h2>Security Risks</h2>
            <p>
                While WolvCapital employs advanced security measures and manual transaction reviews, no system
                is immune to cyber threats or operational disruptions. Potential security risks include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cybersecurity attacks and data breaches</li>
                <li>Technical vulnerabilities in blockchain protocols</li>
                <li>Human error in manual review processes</li>
                <li>System outages or technical failures</li>
                <li>Third-party service provider risks</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Liquidity Risk</h2>
            <p>
                Certain assets or investment plans may have limited liquidity, affecting your ability to
                withdraw or transfer funds promptly. Market conditions, platform policies, or external
                factors may impact the availability of funds when needed. Emergency withdrawals may not
                always be possible due to our manual approval process.
            </p>

            <h2>Technology and Operational Risks</h2>
            <p>
                Digital asset platforms depend on complex technology infrastructure. Risks include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Platform downtime or technical malfunctions</li>
                <li>Loss of private keys or access credentials</li>
                <li>Smart contract vulnerabilities or failures</li>
                <li>Network congestion or transaction delays</li>
                <li>Software bugs or coding errors</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Manual Review Process</h2>
            <p>
                Our manual off-chain approval process, while designed for security, introduces specific risks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing delays of 24-72 hours or longer</li>
                <li>Potential for human error in transaction review</li>
                <li>Limited availability during non-business hours</li>
                <li>Possible rejection of legitimate transactions</li>
                <li>Inability to process urgent or time-sensitive requests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>No Financial Advice</h2>
            <p>
                Information provided on the platform does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.
                WolvCapital does not provide personalized investment recommendations. Users should conduct their
                own research and consult qualified professionals before making investment decisions.
            </p>

            <h2>Loss of Investment</h2>
            <p>
                You may lose some or all of your invested capital. Digital assets can become worthless,
                and there is no guarantee of returns or capital preservation. Past performance does not
                predict future results, and investment values can decline rapidly.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p>
                By participating in WolvCapital's services, you agree to assume full responsibility for
                your investment choices and associated risks. You acknowledge that:
            </p>

                <li>You understand the high-risk nature of cryptocurrency investments</li>
                <li>You are investing only funds you can afford to lose entirely</li>

                <li>You understand that no returns are guaranteed</li>
            </ul>
